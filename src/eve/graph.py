"""Eve's graph.

    START -> load_context -> recall -> eve -> extract -> END

`load_context` is pure local computation. `recall` is the one place ADR 0002
bends: a single bounded, cancellable embedding call, which ships lexical-only
if it misses its budget. `extract` runs after the answer has streamed, so its
latency is invisible. Phase 3 wraps `eve` in a tools loop without reshaping
any of this.

The system prompt is rebuilt from scratch every turn and passed to the model
without being appended to `messages`, so persona, member-context and memory
edits take effect on existing threads instead of being frozen into history.
